# Learning GoO

In this repo, there is just some basic exercises I did while learning Golang with Udemy online courses 
* [Learn How To Code: Google"s Go](https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-how-to-code/)
* [Web Development with Google"s Go](https://www.udemy.com/course/go-programming-language) 
both by Todd McLeod

**Most of the code samples are from this course** (and not mine...)
